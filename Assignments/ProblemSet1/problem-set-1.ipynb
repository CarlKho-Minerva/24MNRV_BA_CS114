Basically, if you copy something someone else wrote or typed, you're doing the wrong thing. If you copy something from someone else and then modify it to look different, you are still doing the wrong thing. If you copy something from an AI tool, you are also doing the wrong thing.\n",

If you use AI tools to solve them, you miss out on the opportunity to puzzle out how the problems work and train your mind to think more clearly about these types of problems in the future."
